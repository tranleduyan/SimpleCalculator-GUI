# About:
 This is my project for Java GUI application practices during my second year in college with the purpose of learning application designs and improving my programming skills and habits.
# Inspiration:
Windows built-in calculator has been a useful and is a need for quick math performance that the Windows users can easily access without installing or searching for a third party. Such a simple but powerful software has solved and improved a lot in Windows user experience, and in a familiar design that any age can understand amd use in their daily lives. 
# Softwares:
Eclipse IDE
# What it does:
A simple Windows-like GUI calculator performs arithmetic operations - multiplication(*), division(/), addition(+), subtraction(-). The calculator will take in by pressing numbers through the graphical buttons and the user can perform operations continuously without having to perform all steps over again, as well as reset the operations. 
# How it is built:
It is built in Java and implemented the graphical interfaces using Java Swing. I first analyzed and studied of how Windows calculator work, and planned out the possible ways to transfer it from a program into a graphical application. After all of the researches that were suitable for my skills to try out - learning about Java Swing documentations, tutorials and its components. I decided to draw out the necessary components and implemented the graphical components with Swing along side with logical programming for the operations.
# What I learned:
1. The importance of GUI in creating an interactable, user-friendly application.
2. Design user-interface skill, and apply them into programming a fully functional application.
3. Java Swing and other aspect in the process of developing a software
